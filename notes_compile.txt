Plan is to use LLVMlite

notes
defining a function
https://llvmlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/ir/examples.html

compiling a function
https://llvmlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/binding/examples.html



might make a function that takes a specific number of args (maybe 2),
creates a LLVM array (of ints, or eventually, floats), then calls a
generated function that takes an array and a stack pointer, does the
compiled code, leaves the result on the stack, returns a new stack
pointer


get pointer to element of array
(hint: getelementptr)

TODO
maybe compile these functions to disk?

made a clean directory bdgforth

uv init bdgforth

uv add numba llvmlite

uv run main.py

added stuff to GitHub
  note - uv makes a .git directory that maybe I should have just
  imported into gitKraken, somehow?

TODO
- branch / branch?
  - requires rewriting the "compile" function to enumerate tokens,
    keep track of an "IF/THEN/ELSE" stack, emitting branch/branch?
    instructions with dummy targets that get fixed up as the stack
    gets unwrapped
- conditionals
  - if/then
  - if/then/else
- loops
  - do/repeat
  - do/while
- variables
  - global, outside of functions
  - local to functions
  - special syntactic sugar to bind args
    - {a b c}
    - would be handy at the top of a function, but wouldn't need to
      be; could throw it in the middle of a function, if I suddenly
      had a bunch of values on the stack that I wanted to grab.
- cleanup parsing (compile and interpret duplicate code)
- floating point values
- booleans as first-class types
- strings
  - print
  - input
- real compilation via LLVM(lite)
  - to native
  - to wasm (emscripten)
- draw mandelbrot set
- some sort of pi approximation
